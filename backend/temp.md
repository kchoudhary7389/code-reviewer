❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){return a + b}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The function `sum` attempts to add two variables, `a` and `b`, without defining or passing them as arguments. This
will likely result in an error or unexpected behavior because `a` and `b` are undefined within the scope of the
function.
* ❌ Missing JSDoc documentation

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
/**
* Sums two numbers.
*
* @param {number} a The first number.
* @param {number} b The second number.
* @returns {number} The sum of a and b.
*/
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:
* ✔ The function now accepts two arguments, `a` and `b`, making it clear that it expects two numbers to sum.
* ✔ Arguments `a` and `b` are defined within the function scope
* ✔ Added JSDoc documentation
